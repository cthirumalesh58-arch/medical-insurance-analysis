🩺 Medical Insurance Analysis Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing medical insurance data to uncover patterns, predict costs, and provide actionable insights for healthcare providers, insurers, and policyholders. Using statistical techniques and machine learning models, the goal is to understand how various factors—such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region—affect insurance charges.

 📊 Objectives:
- Explore and clean the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
- Build predictive models to estimate insurance charges based on personal attributes.
- Visualize key findings to make the data accessible and understandable.
- Provide recommendations for cost optimization and risk assessment.
🧠 Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE
- Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

🔍 Key Insights:
- How lifestyle choices impact insurance premiums.
- Which demographic groups tend to incur higher medical costs.
- Predictive accuracy of different models in estimating charges.
